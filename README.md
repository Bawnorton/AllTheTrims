## Features:
- Allows any item, including modded, to be an armour trim material.
- Makes all armour trimmable, including modded armour.
- Supports custom trim templates from datapacks or mods.
- Dynamic Trim Rendering:
  - All trims are rendered dynamically, so the texture atlas is not filled with trim textures.
  - Colour of the trim is based on the ***average*** colour of the item's texture.
- No additional files or configuration required, just drop the mod in your mods folder.

## Notes:
- This adds over 500,000 new armour trim combinations to just the vanilla game, with a couple of armour mods and content mods this number jumps to over a million with minimal effect on load times.
- The item texture currently does not render the colour of the trim, it will appear white, this is a limitation of how minecraft creates item textures and renders them. I am working around this and trying to figure out a way to make it work, but it has proven to be very difficult.
